        <p class="text-1" align = "justify">Hey there! It's cool that you want to learn about CO2! CO2 is a gas that comes from breathing and burning<br>
          things like coal and oil. A little bit of CO2 is okay, but too much can be bad for people and the Earth.<br>
          By checking the CO2 levels in your classroom and other places in school, you can see if the air is good or<br>
          bad. If there's too much CO2, it can make it hard to breathe and pay attention in class. You can use this<br>
          information to make changes to improve the air quality, like opening windows or using air filters.</p>

        <p class="text-2" align = "justify">Hey there! The data you collect is important because it tells us about the world around us. Just like how<br>
        CO2 levels can show us air quality, data can tell us about things like the weather, animals, or what people<br>
        like to eat. When you put your data in a table, it's easy to compare and understand. You can see how things<br>
        change over time, and compare your data to others'. Tables can also help you see patterns, like if CO2 levels<br>
        are always high on certain days or times.</p>
